# Personal Portfolio Website  Assignment-2(A)

Link to my Website - https://darshan-at.github.io/

## Some Assumptions
- Website is 95% responsive ,working on almost all type of resolutions.
- Mininum width of device is **400px**
- **Internet connection** to load the proper Font/Image/Video and to work fully functional.
- Icon of LinkedIN and Profile Pic(As per Assignment pdf ,Atleast 2 images from external source only) has src from external link/url and other images have src locally from image folder.

## Extra Featuers
- In Education Page, on clicking on different Schooling **< div >s**, you will see the corresponding image changing.
- The above feature works only on **large width devices(width>1000px)** ,and while using it on mobile device ,the image of schooling will not be shown.
- In Skills/Project Section ,There's **video** playing in the top of each Project card. It demonstrates the overview of the corresponding proeject.
- Each Project card has link to the Demo of that corresponding website.
